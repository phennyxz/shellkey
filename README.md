# shellkey
generates a secure password based on the information provided

use:
"sk service email user extra"
any information will be accepted but I recommend following this pattern to make it easier to retrieve forgotten passwords.
service - the platform for which the password is being generated.
email - email used to log in on this platform.
user - user used on the platform.
extra - something reminiscent of that service.

save the script in the preferred directory and create a symbolic link called sk in a path directory
